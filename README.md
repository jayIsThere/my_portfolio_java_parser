# My Portfolio PHP Backend

This repository contains the backend logic for processing form data and generating XML files for the personal website. Built with **PHP** and **Java**, this repository handles the server-side functionality, dynamic content generation, and XML parsing.

## Features
- **PHP Backend**: Processes form data from the frontend, validates it, and generates XML files.
- **Java XML Parser**: Parses and manipulates XML data using Java. This part of the backend is responsible for reading and writing feedback data into XML files.
- **Feedback Table**: Displays collected data from XML files in an HTML table.

## Structure
- **page/**: Contains PHP files for handling form submissions and displaying feedback.
  - `auswertung.php`: Processes form data and generates XML file with feedback.
  - `feedbackTable.php`: Displays the feedback collected in an XML file.
  
- **java_parser/**: Contains Java code for parsing and manipulating XML files.
  - `XMLParser.java`: A Java-based XML parser that processes the XML files generated from the feedback form and provides utilities for reading and writing data in XML format.

## How to Use

### 1. Setting Up the PHP Backend

To set up the PHP backend, you will need to run a local PHP server. After setting up the server, make sure that the HTML form from the [my_portfolio_html_css_frontend](https://github.com/jayIsThere/my_portfolio_html_css_frontend) repository points to this backend.

For example:
```html
<form action="http://localhost/my_portfolio_php_backend/auswertung.php" method="POST">
```

### 2. Using the Java XML Parser

The **Java XML Parser** is responsible for reading and manipulating XML files generated by the PHP backend. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

#### 2.1 Clone or Download the Java Parser Code

Navigate to the `java_parser/` directory in this repository.

#### 2.2 Compile the Java Code

Ensure you have **Java 8 or later** installed on your machine. Then, compile the `XMLParser.java` file:

```bash
javac XMLParser.java
```

#### 2.3 Run the XML Parser

Once the code is compiled, you can run the parser using the following command:

```bash
java XMLParser
```
The parser will process the feedback XML files generated by `auswertung.php`, perform any necessary calculations (e.g., statistics), and output the results to a new XML file.

#### 2.4 XML File Path Configuration

The **XML file path** for reading and writing the feedback data is configured in the `XMLParser.java` file. You can customize the paths as per your environment by modifying the following lines:

```java
private static final String OUTPUT_FILE = "C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\outputfile.xml";
public static void main(String[] args) {
    String directoryPath = "C:\\xampp\\htdocs";  // Change this path as needed
}
```

Simply update the `OUTPUT_FILE` variable and directoryPath to the desired file path on your system. This allows you to control where the XML files are read from and written to.


#### 2.5 Viewing the Output

After running the parser, a new XML file containing the processed data will be generated. You can validate this output and use it as needed for further display or processing.

##### 2.6 Customizing the Parser

If you wish to customize the XML parsing or add additional statistics (such as calculating the percentage of users who want to revisit), you can modify the `XMLParser.java` code.
The parser reads the XML file, manipulates the data, and writes it to a new XML file, ensuring that the feedback data is always up-to-date.
